More and more, citizens, businesses and governments are perceiving the
detrimental impacts of  human-induced global warming on infrastructures, food
sources and populations. As impacts mount, so do calls to act against such
risks. Together with mitigation and adaptation, more focus is been given to
more direct Climate Intervention strategies that might ameliorate impacts,
either by directly reducing COâ‚‚ concentrations (Carbon Dioxide Removal) or by
affecting the planetary energy balance through a reduction in incoming sunlight
(Solar Radiation Modification, SRM). In this talk I will discuss how the
scientific community is investigating SRM, and in particular Stratospheric
Aerosol Injections (SAI) focusing on understanding sources of uncertainties by
bridging the gap between the very small (aerosol microphysics and chemistry)
and the very large (regional precipitation patterns, ecosystems behavior)
through the use of increasingly sophisticated climate models, as well as by
narrowing down a potentially infinite space of scenarios when considering the
complexities of human behavior and international politics.
