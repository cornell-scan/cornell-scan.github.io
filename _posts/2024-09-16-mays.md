In this talk, I will introduce three major challenges for mathematical
modeling as wholesale electricity markets transition to carbon-free resources.
The first challenge is formation of spot prices that adequately convey the
reliability and flexibility needs of the system. The second centers on
volatility, risk management, and supporting efficient long-run investment
decisions. The third concerns coordination of decentralized investment in
generation resources with centralized planning of transmission networks.
