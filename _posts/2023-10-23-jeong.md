We study the mathematical structure of the solution set (and its tangent space)
to the matrix equation $G^* J G = J$ for a given square matrix $J$. In the
language of pure mathematics, this is a Lie group which is the isometry group
for a bilinear (or a sesquilinear) form. The tangent space to $\{G : G^*JG =
J\}$ consists of solutions to the linear matrix equation $X^*J + JX = 0$. We
explicitly demonstrate the computation of the solutions to the equation
$X^* J \pm JX = 0$ for real and complex matrices. We provide numerical examples
and visualizations.
