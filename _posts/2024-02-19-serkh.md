In this talk, we describe an algorithm for approximating functions of the form 
$f(x) = \langle \sigma(\mu),x^\mu \rangle$ over the interval $[0,1]$, where 
$\sigma(\mu)$ is some distribution supported on $[a,b]$, with $0<a<b<\infty$. 
Given the desired accuracy and the values of $a$ and $b$, our method 
determines a priori a collection of non-integer powers, so that functions of 
this form are approximated by expansions in these powers, and a set of 
collocation points, such that the expansion coefficients can be found by 
collocating a given function at these points. Our method has a small uniform 
approximation error which is proportional to the desired accuracy multiplied 
by some small constants, and the number of singular powers and collocation 
points grows logarithmically with the desired accuracy.
