How should one measure the discrepancy between observed and predicted
data? The traditional answer might be the Euclidean distance or a
kernel-based metric. However, in this talk, I will introduce the
geometric advantages of a metric motivated by optimal transport
called the Wasserstein distance. I will use the Wasserstein distance
to solve some challenging inverse problems that are ill-posed,
high-dimensional, and susceptible to noise, where traditional
optimization-based solvers are unreliable as they get stuck in local
minimizers or overfit noise. The Wasserstein distance will allow us
to better account for uncertainties and structural discrepancies
between observed and predicted data. I will also show how optimal
transport-based strategies can be integrated into machine learning
pipelines for solving inverse problems with applications drawn from
physics.
