Many Physics problems are formulated as the minimization of a
functional. Therefore, methods for solving these problems require
differentiating maps whose input and/or output are functions---commonly referred
to as variational differentiation. This procedure is difficult to perform
manually and is poorly addressed by existing symbolic and algorithmic
differentiation systems. In this talk, I will discuss what makes the variational
differentiation challenging to automate. Then I will suggest a pair of
combinators as the silver bullet and showcase their power on a few non-trivial
problems.
