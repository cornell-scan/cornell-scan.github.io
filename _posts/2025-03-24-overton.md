  Robust controllers that stabilize dynamical systems even under disturbances
  and noise are often formulated as solutions of nonsmooth, nonconvex
  optimization problems.
  While methods such as gradient sampling can handle the nonconvexity and
  nonsmoothness, the costs of evaluating the objective function may be
  substantial, making robust control challenging for dynamical systems with
  high-dimensional state spaces.
  In this work, we introduce multi-fidelity variants of gradient sampling that
  leverage low-cost, low-fidelity models with low-dimensional state spaces for
  speeding up the optimization process while nonetheless providing convergence
  guarantees for a high-fidelity model of the system of interest, which is
  primarily accessed in the last phase of the optimization process.
  Our first multi-fidelity method initiates gradient sampling on higher
  fidelity models with starting points obtained from cheaper, lower
  fidelity models.
  Our second multi-fidelity method relies on ensembles of gradients that
  are computed from low- and high-fidelity models.
  Numerical experiments with controlling the cooling of a steel rail profile and
  laminar flow in a cylinder wake demonstrate that our new multi-fidelity
  gradient sampling methods achieve up to two orders of magnitude speedup
  compared to the single-fidelity gradient sampling method that relies on the
  high-fidelity model alone.
