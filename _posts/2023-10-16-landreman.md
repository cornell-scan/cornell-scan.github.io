For several scientific applications, one wants to invert the Biot-Savart Law of
magnetostatics: given a desired magnetic field in some region, what are
electromagnetic coils outside the region to produce this field? This problem
arises in magnetic resonance imaging, particle accelerators, and magnetic
fusion energy. In the latter area, the inverse Biot-Savart problem is central
to the stellarator concept, in which non-axisymmetric fields confine plasmas in
steady state. In this talk, several algorithms for this problem of stellarator
electromagnet design are discussed. One is a new method of topology
optimization for electromagnets, in which algorithms for sparse regression can
be exploited. We also examine how far away the magnets can be from the target
volume, and how this distance can be understood from a physical argument
involving scale lengths.
