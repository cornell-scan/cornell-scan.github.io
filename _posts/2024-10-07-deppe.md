Conservative finite difference and finite volume methods have proven
extremely robust and reliable for magnetohydrodynamics simulations of
binary neutron star mergers, core collapse supernova, and accretion onto
a black hole. However, finite difference methods are generally less accurate and
efficient than spectral methods when the solution is smooth, e.g. away from
the stellar surfaces and shocks. The attractiveness of spectral methods has been
demonstrated by thousands of long and highly accurate binary black hole simulations.
Discontinuous Galerkin methods seek to provide the accuracy of spectral
methods while also robustly capturing shocks in hydrodynamics simulations.
I will give an overview of a discontinuous Galerkin-finite-difference hybrid
method that inherits the best properties of both spectral and finite difference
methods.
