Ion specificity of bulk electrolyte solutions following the Hofmeister series
can induce wide-ranging effects on the dynamics of water - kosmotropic ions
mitigate water mobility and chaotropic ions accelerate water molecules. Many
existing studies of this phenomena apply conventional empirical models which
are inherently limited in transferability and accuracy across a range of
concentrations. In this work, in order to explore ion solvation characteristics
with a first principles level of accuracy, we train neural networks to learn
highly complex and multi-dimensional interactions native to DFT
representations. We find that these potentials overcome the limitations of
conventional empirical force fields in representing water dynamics with
concentration dependence. We then use the potentials to probe the underlying
mechanisms of ion-induced water structure and mobility for a series of alkali
halide ions (KCl, CsCl, NaBr, NaCl) in bulk solution.
